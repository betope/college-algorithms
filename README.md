# College algorithms
## Some algorithms used to learn programming in college

First I used pseudo code, and then did the algorithm in Javascript
After finishing all the exercises using Javascrip, I'm going to do it all using Python.

These exercises cover from basic usage of:
- Variables
- Math operators 
- Logic operators
- Methods and Functions 
- Conditional statements
- Loops and Arrays
